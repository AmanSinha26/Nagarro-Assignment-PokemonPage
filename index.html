        <h2>GARY</h2>
        <p>Gary Oak is a character appearing in Pokémon the Series. He is the grandson of Professor Oak and the rival of
            Ash
            Ketchum in the first few seasons. His Starter Pokémon was a Squirtle, later evolving into a Blastoise.
            The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His
            chosen starter Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start
            with, and he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, and they would go so
            far as crying whenever he lost. He didn't walk on his journeys like most Trainers did; instead he had his
            own sporty red convertible with a chauffeur. Gary loved when he got a chance to make fun of Ash by bragging
            about how far behind Ash was compared to him. He also gave Ash the pet-name of "Ashy-boy" (Japanese:
            "Satoshi-kun"), which occasionally seems to annoy him.
